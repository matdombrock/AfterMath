# IFAQS (Infrequently Asked Questions)

## Do you like Windows the best?
No.

## Then why is there only a Windows build? 
I'm currently only using Windows on a daily basis and have no access to a MacOS device. That being said, there is no reason this can't/won't be built for other platforms down the road. Feel free to submit a PR.  

## Why is this like 100+ Mb installed, and why does it use so much RAM?
AfterMath is written in Electron. 

## Why Electron?
Because I am primarily a web developer and Electron allows me (and potential future contributors) to use a stack we already know well to build desktop applications. 

## I don't like the way X feature works!
Feel free to submit an issue or a PR with a fix.

## I can't get this to run on my machine!
I'm sorry. Feel free to open an issue and I'll see what I can do.

## Is this the end of the document?
Yes.
